# Enhanced RAG System with Dynamic Processing

🚀 **Universal Research Paper Analysis System** - An advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that can process ANY research paper dynamically. Features summary-first processing, automated concept extraction, targeted embeddings, and intelligent retrieval for superior question-answering performance.

Built with FAISS, LangChain, OpenAI, and memory integration capabilities.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenAI API key
- LangSmith API key (optional, for tracing)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RAG.git
   cd RAG
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install python-dotenv langchain langchain-openai langchain-community faiss-cpu pypdf requests langgraph
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your_langsmith_api_key_here  # Optional
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Open `RAG.ipynb`** in your browser

3. **Run cells in order** - The notebook includes verification cells to ensure everything works correctly

### 🎯 Process Any Paper Instantly

```python
# Process any research paper from arXiv
result = process_any_research_paper("https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.00001")

# Or process a local PDF file
result = process_any_research_paper("/path/to/your/paper.pdf")

# Ask questions using either pipeline
answer = graph.invoke({"question": "Who are the authors?"})
answer = enhanced_graph.invoke({"question": "What is the main contribution?"})
```

## ✨ Key Features

### 🌟 **Universal Compatibility**
- **Works with ANY research paper** - arXiv URLs or local PDF files
- **Dynamic metadata extraction** - automatically extracts title, authors, institutions, dates
- **No hardcoded dependencies** - adapts to any paper format

### 🧠 **Intelligent Processing** 
- **Summary-first approach** - generates comprehensive summaries before creating embeddings
- **Automated concept extraction** - identifies technical terms, methods, findings automatically
- **Targeted embeddings** - creates specialized embeddings for concepts, summaries, and metadata

### 🔍 **Advanced Retrieval**
- **Query-aware search** - adapts retrieval strategy based on question type
- **Multi-source context** - combines metadata, concepts, summaries, and content
- **Enhanced accuracy** - significantly better answers compared to basic RAG

### 🧬 **Knowledge Integration**
- **Memory system ready** - MCP-compatible knowledge graph storage
- **Cross-paper connections** - builds relationships between concepts and papers
- **Structured knowledge** - entities, relations, and observations

## 💡 Usage Examples

### 📝 **Question Types Supported**

**Metadata Questions** (optimized retrieval)
- "What is the title of this paper?"
- "Who are the authors?"
- "When was this paper published?"
- "What institutions are the authors from?"

**Concept Definitions** (uses targeted concept embeddings)  
- "What is context engineering?"
- "Define prompt engineering"
- "Explain the main methodology"

**Summary Queries** (leverages comprehensive summaries)
- "What is this paper about?"
- "What are the main contributions?"  
- "Summarize the key findings"

**Technical Questions** (multi-source context assembly)
- "How do the authors approach the problem?"
- "What are the experimental results?"
- "What are the implications of this research?"

### 🔄 **Processing Different Papers**

```python
# Process different research areas
nlp_paper = process_any_research_paper("https://arxiv.org/pdf/2023.12345")  # NLP paper
cv_paper = process_any_research_paper("https://arxiv.org/pdf/2024.56789")   # Computer Vision  
ml_paper = process_any_research_paper("/local/path/ml_paper.pdf")          # Local ML paper

# Each automatically adapts to the paper's domain and content
```

## 🔧 System Architecture

### 🏗️ **Processing Pipeline**
1. **Download/Load** → PDF from URL or local file
2. **Dynamic Metadata Extraction** → LLM extracts paper-specific information
3. **Summary Generation** → Comprehensive structured summary
4. **Concept Extraction** → Automated identification of key terms and concepts  
5. **Targeted Embeddings** → Specialized embeddings for different document types
6. **Enhanced Vector Store** → Multi-source FAISS store with intelligent retrieval
7. **Memory Integration** → Knowledge graph creation (MCP compatible)

### 🧪 **Built-in Verification**
The system includes comprehensive testing:
- Component status verification
- Functionality testing for both basic and enhanced pipelines
- Cross-paper compatibility validation
- Performance metrics and accuracy assessment

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **FAISS Installation Error**
   ```bash
   # On Mac with M1/M2:
   pip install faiss-cpu --no-cache-dir
   
   # Alternative for compatibility issues:
   conda install faiss-cpu -c conda-forge
   ```

2. **API Key Errors**
   - Ensure your `.env` file is in the project root
   - Check that API keys are valid and have proper permissions
   - Verify OpenAI account has sufficient credits

3. **Memory Issues with Large Papers**
   - System handles papers up to ~500 pages efficiently
   - For very large documents, use `create_enhanced_rag=False` for basic processing
   - Consider splitting very large papers into sections

4. **Dynamic Metadata Extraction Issues**
   - System includes robust fallback handling
   - Partial extraction continues if some metadata is missing
   - Check notebook output for detailed error information

### 🚨 **Error Recovery**
The enhanced system includes:
- Graceful degradation when components fail
- Automatic fallbacks for failed JSON parsing
- Informative error messages with suggested fixes
- Component status checking before execution
