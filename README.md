# 🤖 Smart Research Paper Assistant

**Ever wish you had a super-smart study buddy who could read any research paper and answer your questions about it?** That's exactly what this is!

🎯 **Perfect for students, researchers, and anyone who needs to understand research papers quickly!**

**What it does:**
- 📄 You give it any research paper (PDF or link)
- 🧠 It reads and understands the entire paper in 2 minutes
- ❓ You ask questions in plain English
- 💬 It gives you detailed, accurate answers instantly

**No more spending hours reading papers you barely understand!** ⏰

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenAI API key
- LangSmith API key (optional, for tracing)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nhp-atel/RAG.git
   cd RAG
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install all the packages you need** 📦
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(This installs everything automatically - no need to remember individual package names!)*

4. **Add your API keys** 🔑
   
   Create a `.env` file in the main folder and add your keys:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-key-here
   LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your-langsmith-key-here  # Optional but helpful for debugging
   ```
   
   🚨 **Important**: Get your OpenAI API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   
   💡 **Tip**: The LangSmith key is optional - you can leave it out if you don't have one!

### 🎮 Running Your Smart Assistant

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook** 🚀
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   *This opens a web page where you can run your code!*

2. **Click on `RAG.ipynb`** in the file list that appears 📖

3. **Run the code step-by-step** ⚡
   - Click on the first cell and press `Shift + Enter`
   - Keep doing this for each cell in order
   - Watch the magic happen as your assistant learns about papers!
   
   💡 **Don't worry if you see some loading messages - that's normal!**

### 🎯 Try It With Any Paper!

```python
# 📄 From the internet (arXiv papers)
result = process_any_research_paper("https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.00001")

# 💻 From your computer
result = process_any_research_paper("/Users/yourname/Downloads/cool_paper.pdf")

# ❓ Ask questions and get instant answers!
answer = graph.invoke({"question": "Who wrote this paper?"})
answer = enhanced_graph.invoke({"question": "What's the main idea?"})
```

🌟 **That's it!** Your assistant now understands the entire paper and can answer any questions about it!

# 🧬 Biology, 🧪 Chemistry, 🔭 Physics, 📊 Economics - anything!
```

✨ **The system is smart enough to understand any field of research automatically!**

## 🔧 How It Actually Works (The Magic Behind The Scenes)

### 🏗️ **What Happens When You Process a Paper**
1. **📥 Gets the Paper** → Downloads PDF or opens your local file
2. **🔍 Reads Everything** → Extracts title, authors, and all content
3. **📝 Creates Summary** → Writes a comprehensive summary of the whole paper
4. **🏷️ Finds Key Concepts** → Identifies important technical terms and ideas  
5. **🧠 Creates Smart Memory** → Builds specialized understanding for different parts
6. **🗃️ Organizes Knowledge** → Stores everything in a searchable way
7. **💾 Remembers Connections** → Links concepts between different papers you process

### ✅ **Quality Checks Built-In**
Don't worry - the system checks itself:
- ✅ Verifies all components are working properly
- ✅ Tests both basic and advanced features
- ✅ Makes sure it works with different types of papers
- ✅ Monitors how well it's performing

🎯 **Think of it as having a really smart librarian who reads everything and remembers it perfectly!**

## 🛠️ When Things Don't Work (Don't Panic!)

### 😅 **"Help! Something's Broken!"**

**🍎 Mac Users with M1/M2 Chips:**
```bash
# If you get FAISS errors, try this:
pip install faiss-cpu --no-cache-dir

# Still broken? Try this instead:
conda install faiss-cpu -c conda-forge
```

**🔑 "Invalid API Key" Errors:**
- 🔍 Double-check your `.env` file is in the main RAG folder
- 💳 Make sure your OpenAI account has credit/isn't expired
- ✏️ Copy-paste your API key again (no extra spaces!)

**📚 "Paper Too Big" Errors:**
- 📏 Works great with papers up to ~500 pages
- 🔧 For huge papers, add `create_enhanced_rag=False` when processing
- ✂️ You can also split massive papers into smaller sections

**❓ "Can't Find Paper Info" Issues:**
- 😌 Don't worry! The system keeps trying different ways
- 📊 Check the notebook output - it shows what's happening
- 🔄 Sometimes it takes a moment to extract everything

### 🚨 **Smart Error Handling**
**The system is pretty resilient:**
- 🛠️ Automatically tries backup methods when something fails
- 💬 Gives you clear error messages (not cryptic tech speak!)
- 🔍 Checks everything is working before starting
- 📈 Keeps running even if some parts have issues

🤗 **Remember: If you're stuck, the error messages will guide you to the solution!**

- ❌ Hardcoded for one specific paper only
- ❌ Simple chunk-based retrieval  
- ❌ No concept understanding
- ❌ Limited metadata handling
- ❌ One-size-fits-all approach

### ✅ **After (Enhanced RAG)**  
- ✅ Works with ANY research paper universally
- ✅ Summary-first processing with concept extraction
- ✅ Intelligent query-aware retrieval
- ✅ Dynamic metadata extraction
- ✅ Memory integration and knowledge graphs
- ✅ Multi-source context assembly
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and verification

## 📋 **Where to Find Help**

- **📖 [README.md](README.md)** - This student-friendly guide you're reading now!
- **🔧 [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** - Technical details (for when you want to understand how it works)
- **📓 [RAG.ipynb](RAG.ipynb)** - The actual code you run (step-by-step instructions included)

💡 **Start with the notebook - everything you need is there with explanations!**

## 🔒 **Keeping Your API Keys Safe**

- 🚫 **Never share your `.env` file** (it has your secret API keys!)
- ✅ **The system automatically hides it** from Git (so you can't accidentally upload it)
- 🛡️ **Built-in safety checks** (validates everything before running)
- 🏢 **For real projects**: Use separate API keys for testing vs. production

🔐 **Think of API keys like your house key - keep them private!**

## 🤝 **Want to Make It Even Better?**

**This system is built to grow! You can:**
- 📈 **Add new ways to understand concepts** (maybe for your specific field)
- 🧬 **Create specialized versions** (like one just for biology papers)
- 🧠 **Improve the memory system** (help it remember more connections)  
- ⚡ **Make it faster** (optimize for your specific needs)

🚀 **Perfect for computer science students working on projects!**

## 📄 **Important Legal Stuff**

🎓 **This is for learning and research!** Perfect for:
- Class assignments and projects
- Understanding papers for your thesis
- Research work (following your university's guidelines)

⚠️ **Just remember:**
- Make sure you're allowed to process the PDFs you use
- Respect copyright (don't redistribute papers illegally)
- Follow fair use - this is for understanding, not copying

📚 **Think of it like using a library - you can read and learn, but don't copy entire books!**
