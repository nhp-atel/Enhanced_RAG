# Enhanced RAG System with Dynamic Processing and Concept Extraction

## Overview
This project implements an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using FAISS for vector storage, LangChain for orchestration, and OpenAI's models for embeddings and generation. The system features dynamic metadata extraction, summary-first processing, automated concept extraction, and targeted embeddings to work with ANY research paper.

## Key Features
- **Universal Paper Processing**: Works with any research paper (arXiv URLs or local files)
- **Dynamic Metadata Extraction**: Automatically extracts title, authors, institutions, dates from any paper
- **Summary-First Processing**: Generates comprehensive summaries before creating embeddings
- **Concept Extraction**: Automatically identifies and extracts key technical terms and concepts
- **Targeted Embeddings**: Creates specialized embeddings for concepts, summaries, and metadata
- **Multi-Source Retrieval**: Adaptive search that prioritizes relevant document types based on query
- **Memory Integration**: MCP-compatible knowledge graph storage for structured information
- **Enhanced Context Assembly**: Combines metadata, concepts, summaries, and content for rich responses
- **LangSmith Integration**: Full tracing for debugging and monitoring
- **Environment Variables**: Secure API key management via .env file

## Technical Implementation

### Dynamic Document Processing
1. **Download/Load**: Handles arXiv URLs or local PDF files universally
2. **Dynamic Metadata Extraction**: Uses LLM to extract paper-specific metadata:
   - Title, authors, institutions, publication dates
   - ArXiv IDs, keywords, abstracts
   - Works with any paper format automatically
3. **Summary Generation**: Creates comprehensive structured summaries covering:
   - Research problems and motivations
   - Main contributions and findings  
   - Methodologies and technical concepts
   - Related work and implications
4. **Concept Extraction**: Automatically identifies and categorizes:
   - Technical terms and algorithms
   - Key conceptual frameworks
   - Methodological approaches
   - Important findings and results
5. **Document Chunking**: Splits content with 800 character size and 150 character overlap

### Enhanced Vector Store
- **Multi-Document Types**: Combines original chunks with specialized documents:
  - Metadata documents (paper details)
  - Summary documents (comprehensive overviews)
  - Concept documents (definitions and explanations)
  - Original content chunks (detailed passages)
- **FAISS Implementation**: Uses OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model
- **Strategic Insertion**: Places metadata documents at multiple positions for reliable retrieval

### Adaptive Query Pipeline
1. **Query Classification**: Automatically categorizes questions:
   - Metadata queries (authors, dates, titles)
   - Concept definitions (technical terms, explanations)
   - Summary queries (overviews, main points)
   - Method queries (techniques, approaches)
   - Finding queries (results, conclusions)

2. **Multi-Source Retrieval**: Prioritizes relevant document types:
   - Metadata docs for factual questions
   - Concept docs for definitions
   - Summary docs for overviews
   - Content chunks for detailed information

3. **Enhanced Generation**: Assembles rich context from multiple sources:
   - Paper metadata (structured facts)
   - Relevant concepts (definitions)
   - Paper summary (comprehensive overview)
   - Document content (specific details)
   - Memory system information (structured knowledge)

## System Architecture

### Universal Processing Function
The system provides a single function to process any research paper:

```python
# Process any paper dynamically
result = process_any_research_paper("https://arxiv.org/pdf/paper_id")
result = process_any_research_paper("/path/to/local/paper.pdf")

# Returns complete processing results:
# - paper_info: Extracted metadata
# - paper_summary: Generated summary  
# - key_concepts: Extracted concepts
# - vector_store: Enhanced FAISS store
# - concept_documents: Targeted embeddings
```

### Memory Integration (MCP Compatible)
- Creates structured knowledge graphs with entities and relations
- Stores paper metadata, authors, concepts, and their relationships
- Enables cross-paper knowledge discovery and reasoning
- Compatible with MCP memory protocols

## Usage

### Quick Start
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install python-dotenv langchain langchain-openai langchain-community faiss-cpu pypdf requests langgraph
```

2. Set up environment variables in `.env`:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

3. Run the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook RAG.ipynb
```

### Processing Any Paper
```python
# Basic usage - process any arXiv paper
result = process_any_research_paper("https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.00001")

# Process local PDF
result = process_any_research_paper("/path/to/my_paper.pdf")

# Basic processing only (faster, no enhanced features)
result = process_any_research_paper(paper_url, create_enhanced_rag=False)
```

### Query Examples
```python
# Use basic RAG
answer = graph.invoke({"question": "Who are the authors?"})

# Use enhanced RAG with concept awareness
answer = enhanced_graph.invoke({
    "question": "What is context engineering?",
    "context": [], "answer": "", "memory_context": ""
})
```

## System Verification
The notebook includes comprehensive verification:
- Component status checking
- Functionality testing for both pipelines  
- Dynamic processing validation with different papers
- Performance and accuracy metrics

## Key Improvements Over Basic RAG

### 2. Enhanced Understanding  
- **Before**: Simple chunk-based retrieval
- **After**: Summary-first processing with concept extraction and targeted embeddings

### 3. Intelligent Retrieval
- **Before**: One-size-fits-all similarity search
- **After**: Query-aware retrieval that adapts to question type

### 4. Rich Context Assembly
- **Before**: Basic context concatenation  
- **After**: Multi-source context from metadata, concepts, summaries, and content

### 5. Knowledge Integration
