Future studies are encouraged to explore methods that do not rely on this assumption, such as the statistical procedures and image processing techniques mentioned. This could lead to more robust extraction models that account for mixed pixels.\n",

Future research should address the standardization of uncertainty reporting, which is crucial for evaluating the reliability of models especially in the absence of ground truth. Developing methods to quantify uncertainties could enhance model trustworthiness, particularly for new observational scenarios.\n",

      "4. **Integration of Deep Learning**: The potential for combining deep learning approaches, such as Bayesian neural networks, with traditional statistical methods is a notable direction for future research. This integration could improve modeling frameworks and lead to advances in estimation techniques, particularly when applied to new hyper-cubes from celestial observations.\n",

Future work could focus on creating and sharing public datasets that represent ideal scenarios, in order to support the ongoing development and testing of unmixing methods.\n",
